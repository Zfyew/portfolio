# Portfolio

My personal portfolio site. Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. No frameworks, no build tools, just a single file.

The design went through a lot of iterations. Started minimal, ended up going full Akatsuki theme. Deep crimson, rain animation, shuriken watermark in the background. There's a Glitching/Tsukuyomi effect on my name that triggers every 10 seconds if you wait for it.

Fonts are Bebas Neue, JetBrains Mono and Noto Serif JP.
